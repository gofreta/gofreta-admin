Gofreta Admin UI is a frontend admin interface for the Gofreta REST API. It is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

> For more detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [Vue Webpack guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).


## Install

Download the project archive, edit the configuration settings located in `config/app.js` and then run the appropriate commands:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# run all tests
npm test

# build for production with minification (new dist folder will be created)
npm run build
